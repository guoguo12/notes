# Lecture 1

Basic business activities
  Financing = raising money (via equity or debt) to finance investing/operating
  Investing = purchasing assets for production of goods / delivery of services
  Operating = producing goods/services to generate a profit
    Can be manufacturer, merchandiser, or service

Accounting
  Identify economic events, record/classify/summarize them, prepare reports

Who uses reports?
  External
    Investors, to decide whether to buy/sell stock
    Creditors, to decide whether to lend money
    Suppliers/customers, to decide whether to sell/buy goods
  Internal
    Managers, to decide how to maximize profits

Four financial statements
  Statement of cash flows
  Balance sheet
  Income statement
  Statement of stockholders' equity
Provided by companies annually to the SEC via Form 10-K

Income statement
  Step-by-step breakdown of revenue and expenses (including interest and taxes)

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)
  Rules for reporting financial information for publicly-traded companies
  E.g., revenue is recognized when earned, not when the cash is collected
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
  Private sector group
  Responsible for the GAAP, mostly (in conjunction with the SEC)
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
  Possibly replacement for the GAAP

Role of management
  Management is responsible for preparing financial information for the 10-K
  Sarbanes-Oxley Act: CEOs/CFOs must certify the accuracy of their 10-Ks
Enron scandal
  Used "creative" accounting practices to inflate their assets and net income

Independent auditors
  SEC requires audits by independent accountants, who ensure GAAP compliance
  Auditors grade the "fairness" (correctness) of the financial statements

# Lecture 2

How do companies handle sales returns?
  It depends, but they must disclose their policies in the footnotes
    E.g., Nordstrom's estimates returns using historical data
  This is a possible opportunity for embellishment

Balance sheet = statement of assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity
  Assets: cash, accounts receivable, inventory, buildings, land, ...
    Accounts receivable = money owed by customers from prior sales
  Liabilities: accounts/notes payable, accrued expenses, long-term debt, ...
    Accounts payable = money owed to suppliers/creditors
    Notes payable = money owed via promissory notes, e.g., to banks
  Stockholders' equity:
    Contributed capital = amount invested by stockholders
    Retained capital = past earnings not distributed (as dividends)
    Treasury stock (negative) = stock repurchased using Treasury notes
Accounting equation: assets = liabilities + stockholders' equity
Income statement covers a time period, balance sheet covers a specific moment

Mixed-attribute measurement
  Most assets are valued at their historical costs (what was paid)
  But this doesn't make sense for certain assets, like buildings
    E.g., the Transamerica Pyramid cost $32M in 1972, but is now worth far more
  So under GAAP, different measurement methods are used for different assets

Accrual accounting
  Revenues are recognized when earned, expenses are recognized when incurred
Cash basis accounting
  Revenue/expenses are recognized when cash changes hands
  Mostly used by small businesses and for personal finances

How are gift card purchases recognized?
  Initially: cash account is debited and deferred revenue is credited
  When redeemed: debit deferred revenue, credit sales revenue

# Lecture 3

Guidance = estimates of future performance provided by a company
  Not required, but common practice

Depreciation = spreading out a tangible asset's cost over its lifetime
  Amortization = the same concept, but for intangible assets (e.g., trademarks)

Statement of cash flows
  Shows how various activities changed cash throughout the year
    Types of activities: operating, investing, financing
  Useful in determining a company's short-term viability

Factors in investment decisions
  Financial information: 10-K
  Company strategy: product differentiation or low cost?
  Other: general economic conditions, political climate, industry outlook

Tools of financial analysis
  Horizontal analysis = look at trends across time
    E.g., are revenue and EPS going up?
  Vertical analysis = look at account makeups as proportions
    E.g., each income statement item is given as a percentage of gross sales
    Allows for easy comparison to related companies and across time
  Ratio analysis = look at key ratios

Examples of ratios in ratio analysis
  Profitability ratios
    Return on assets = net income / average total assets
      Measures how effectively assets are being used to generate profits
    Return on equity = net income / average stockholders' equity
    Return on sales (profit margin) = net income / net sales revenue
      Shows how much of every $1 in sales flows through to net income
  Liquidity ratios
    Current ratio = current assets / current liabilities

# Lecture 4

Capital budgeting = analysis of investing in capital assets
  Many possible decisions: equipment selection, lease/buy, plant expansion, ...

Budgeting methods
  Payback method: how long will it take to get my money back?
  NPV method: if the NPV is positive/zero, the project is acceptable
    Based on cash flows (including timings), unlike accrual accounting
  IRR method: if the IRR is above a preset threshold, the project is acceptable
    When comparing two projects with the same cost, higher IRR is better

# Lecture 8

Four employee responses to dissatisfaction
  Constructive active: voice (talk to supervisor)
  Destructive active: exit
  Constructive passive: loyalty (waiting for conditions to improve)
  Destructive passive: neglect/theft

How to avoid low job satisfaction
  Pay attention to signs of dissatisfaction (e.g., absenteeism)
  Measure job attitudes regularly
  Evaluate fit between what employees are doing and what they want to do

Theories of motivation
  Maslow's hierarchy of needs
    Physiological, safety, love/belonging, esteem, self-actualization
  McClelland's theory of needs
    Achievement, power, affiliation

How to provide motivation
  Job rotation = periodic shifting between tasks
  Relational job design = connect employees with beneficiaries of their work
  Employee involvement = use employee input to increase their commitment level
    Examples: participative management and representative participation
    Story: taking worker input at a Kingsford Charcoal plant upped productivity
  Alternate work arrangements
    Examples: telecommuting and flexible work schedules

Should a leader admit to their subordinates when they don't know what to do?
  Perhaps confident leadership inspires confident action?
    This is certainly necessary in extreme or life-or-death situations
  Or is honest, transparent leadership refreshing?

# Lecture 10

Elements of organizational culture
  Innovation and risk-taking
  Attention to detail
  Outcome orientation
  People orientation
  Team orientation
  Aggressiveness
  Stability

Story: Coca-Cola had friendly culture, Pepsi did not
  Pepsi said its mission was to kill Coca-Cola

Example: Zappos has really strong culture
  All employees must take phone calls and do warehouse work during training
  Trainees are offerred money if they choose to leave during training
  Employees contribute to an annual "culture book", sharing their experiences
  The CEO works in a regular cubicle and lives in a trailer
Amazon bought Zappos but runs it as a separate entity
In 2016, Zappos decided to flatten the company more and reduce management
  Employees felt lost and wanted more feedback

Most organizaions have numerous subcultures
  E.g., faculty at Cal in different departments

Culture differs from formalization
  E.g., the strict rules of the military is formalization, not culture

What does culture do?
  Conveys a sense of identity
  Facilitates the generation of commitment
  Enhances social stability
  Serves as a sense-making and control mechanism

Culture creates climate (shared views about the organization and environment)
  Climate influences behavior and habits

Negative effects of culture
  Used for discrimination, e.g., in SV tech companies
  Used to justify harmful activities, e.g., hazing in frats

Example: General Mills sought a target culture, so they profiled their execs
  Not a great sample

Cultures are an asset, especially to millennials

# Lecture 11

Comparison of airport trains
  Shanghai maglev train
    Fast (270 mph) but inconvenient
    Only tourists use it
  Hong Kong Airport Express
    Slow but convenient
The Shanghai maglev's speed is a product feature but does not provide value

Value proposition is the heart of marketing
Components of delivered value:
  Customer value:
    Product value
    Image value (self-expression benefits)
      Can signal status, wealth, affiliation, concern for the environment, ...
      Consider driving a Land Rover vs. a Ford Pinto
  Customer costs:
    Monetary cost
    Time cost
      Consider shopping online vs. locally
    Energy cost (how difficult is the decision)
      Consider all-inclusive travel packages

Not all product features provide value
  AT&T had (failed) ads showing customers checking their emails at the beach

Value propositions customers might care about:
  Fashion
  Design, e.g., Apple laptops
  Efficacy (it works), e.g., Fedex overnight shipping
  Durability
  Convenience
  Guarantee
  Enhanced offering (complete solution), e.g., BMWs come with maintenance

Microsoft Cloud Barcelona ad
  No value proposition
  Not clear what Microsoft does

Steps to marketing strategy: define, segment, design, position

Define the market
  Opportunities come from unmet or poorly met needs
    E.g., taxis in SF were bad, so Uber and Lyft thrived
  The market = people/firms who need our product and can pay for it
  Defining the market broadly can lead to new ideas
    Do people want taxis per se or just to get between places?

Segment the market and choose attractive segments
  Target marketing works better than mass/undifferentiated marketing
  Firms that target well avoid head-to-head competition
Possible segment dimensions
  Geographic
  Demographics
  Psychological
  Product use, e.g., hobbyists vs. professionals
Most segments are multi-dimensional
Many firms have many offerings target to different segments, e.g., Marriott

Design a marketing mix and appeal to the target
  Four P's:
    Product, including modifications target customers need
    Price, including finance options
    Place (channel of distribution)
    Promotion
Trend analysis can reveal future opportunities
  The creation of the TSA created a market for travel-size personal items
  Inflation in India means more people want to buy gold
  Air pollution in Beijing is an opportunity for air purifier manufacturers
  More multiple births in the US means twin strollers are in demand

Position the offering (in the minds of customers, as compared to competitors)
  Examples: "classic", "family friendly", "suitable for every day", "American"
Positioning is difficult
  Often, positioning must happen before product development even begins
  The achieved position may not be the one intended
  Most products can be positioned in several different ways
    Example: Polaroid ads ("easy to use" vs. "discreet")
  The desired position may have been pre-empted by a competitor
    You can't position your city as "the most romantic place on Earth"
  The competitive position may depend on geography
    Honda is youthful in Japan but family-friendly in the US
  Positioning has to be credible
    Dunkin' Donuts can't market itself as "healthy" (but "comfort food" works)
  Positioning can nudge, but it can't make magic leaps
    Wal-Mart bought a Vogue ad to position itself as "fashionable"

Why are big companies make rediculous marketing errors?
  Lack of testing, critical thinking, and assertive management
  The ad agency gives a "you're going to love this" pitch
  Correct response:
    "Don't explain it to me, because the ad won't have you explaining it"
    "Did you test it?"
Examples of bad ads
  Coca-Cola Mexico ad
    Depicts White youths in a poor Mexican town building a Christmas tree
  Pepsi ad

What challenges are specific to B2B marketing?
  Businesses have fixed budgets
    Possible solution: give them freebies
  Mass-media advertising isn't particularly useful
    Example: billboards featuring highly technical products

# Lecture 12

Products include pure goods, pure services, and everything in between
  Services are tough
    Can't be made in advance
    Can't be stored and shipped
    Most innovations can be instantly cloned

Firms provide three levels of product
  Core benefit
    Non-tangible value provided
  Actual product
    Brand name, features, design, packaging, quality level
  Augmented product
    Installation, warranty, customer service

Two bankruptcies and one positive example
  Kodak
    Failed to respond to rise of digital cameras
    Actual product (film cameras) was excellent, but core benefit was outdated
  Saturn (GM subsidiary)
    Focused on making customer experience pleasant, but actual product was bad
  Netflix
    Understood that the core benefit was "watching movies at home"
    Embraced streaming after investing hundreds of millions on mailing services

New product development (NPD)
  Idea generation
    Most firms have too many good ideas
    New products come from pain points
      Example: the Dyson Airblade was a response to the conventional hand dryer
  Idea screening
    Products must be feasible and match manufacturing/distribution expertise
  Concept development and testing
    Often involves a storyboard or prototype
    Gives an idea of acceptable price and must-have features
  Marketing strategy development
    Determine marketing mix
  Business analysis
    Determines business viability
  Product development
    Note that this comes relatively late in the sequence
  Market testing
    Real-life testing is losing popularity due to media leakage
      Alternative: simulation, e.g., in a fake supermarket, after watching ads
    Peoria, Illinois, is a traditional US test market
      Seen as a prototypical American city with representative demographics
    New Zealand is a good test market for apps
      English-speaking, small, isolated
  Commercialization ("roll-out")

US firms are rather good at NPD
  It is well-studied in business schools
Most firms have a portfolio approach
  Mix of moonshots, likely successes, and regular product development

Main advice regarding NPD
  Recognize when you are in a NPD situation
  Understand that there will be many ideas but few winners
  Use a well-balanced porfolio of ideas to manage risk

Lean Startup methodology
  Associated with Eric Ries and Steve Blank
  Embraced as the standard in Silicon Valley
    The scientific approach to entrepreneurship has appeal
  Goes against a lot of what traditional NPD stands for
  Main tenets:
    Entrepreneurship is not luck
    Build a MVP
      Smallest set of features that a reasonably tech-savvy user would want
    Iterate quickly
    Prototype rapidly and do a lot of A/B testing

Product life cycle (PLC) conventional wisdom
  Introduction
    Keep the product line narrow
    Either keep prices high (skim) or launch cheap (penetration)
    Spend liberally on ads and attempt to get PR coverage
    Example: solid-state drives
  Growth
    Add more channels (broader distribution)
    Watch for "me too" new entrants
    Compete on features and performance
    Example: electric cars
  Maturity
    Focus on stealing customers, because nobody is new to the product anymore
    Consider "freshening" brand with new claims and product modifications
    Example: most consumer packaged goods (e.g., detergent)
  Decline
    Competing technology has been announced
    Consider exiting the market (e.g., IBM with typewriters)
    Simplify product line, limit distribution and advertising
    Example: CRT computer displays

A brand is a seller's promise to deliver a set of benefits consistently
  It is a shorthand and a differentiator
  If the promise is strong enough, the brand speaks for itself
    Example: full-page Clinique ad that just depicts the product

Good examples of branding:
  Geek Squad, Best Buy's service and install business
    Heavy investment in brand-building, e.g., cars and uniforms
  Travelex
    Bought up many regionalized airport money-changers
    Launched a new blue and red corporate identity
Examples of muddled branding:
  Starbucks coffee
    Starbucks-branded coffee is served in styrofoam cups on United flights
  Cacao Reserve, a line of fancy chocolates by Hershey
    Their packaging included "by Hershey's", but Hershey's isn't luxurious

External features of the brand
  Name
    Must be short, pronounceable, and must not mean anything silly
      Negative examples: Hyundai, I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!, Bimbo
    Should be suggestive of the benefit offered
      Negative example: Toyota Siena
  Logo and color
    Should be distinctive and consistent
  Sound and smell
  Brand essence statement
    Defines what the brand means to customers
    Example: "ingredients for life" (Safeway)

Brand architecture
  Managing the relationship between the firm's name and the product's name
  Contrast "Courtyard by Marriott" with Ritz-Carlton (also owned by Marriott)

Co-branding = strategically mixing brands in a single product
  Very common because there are so many well-developed national brands
  Examples: Dell/Intel laptops, Kellogg's/Smucker's Pop-tarts

Multi-brand strategy = one company owns many brands that appear to compete
  Can target all segments of the market
  Example: Unilever owns Breyers, Good Humor, Klondike, Ben and Jerry's, ...

White label brand = a product produced for rebranding by other companies
  Used for store-brand products

# Lecture 13

Article on subscription services
  Rolls-Royce rents out engines ("Power by the Hour") instead of selling them

Three possible pricing objectives
  Maximize contribution per unit sold
  Maximize units sold (market share)
  Signaling to competitors ("we will fight") and customers (positioning)

Price signals quality under conditions of uncertainty
  Because of TripAdvisor, hotels can't overcharge based on false claims

Types of revenue streams
  Transactions
    Asset sale
    Usage (e.g., cell phone minutes)
    Renting (e.g., Hertz)
  Subscription
  Licensing
  Brokerage/agency
  Third party
    Advertising

Introduction-stage pricing strategy
  Skimming
    Charge highest possible price that some people will pay
    Pluck off "price insensitive" customers first, then ride price curve down
    Use when the market is segmentable
    Examples: DSLR cameras (initially) and the Oculus Rift
  Penetration
    Ensure almost everyone in the market can pay for it
    Use heavy mass media advertising to communicate value
    Use when everyone wants the same thing
  Don't employ a neutral strategy between skimming and penetration
    Leaves money on the table from price-insensitive early adopters
    Discourages immediate broad adoption

Cost-based pricing = tie price to cost
  Pros
    Scientific (just the facts)
    Ensures we don't sell at a loss
  Cons
    Ignores the competition
    Unclear whether we should use full or marginal cost
Going-rate pricing = tie price to competitors' prices
  Pros
    Requires little effort
    Responsive to market forces
  Cons
    Doesn't account for differentiation
Pricing by relative value = compute economic value, adjust for differentiation
  Pros
    Competitive
  Cons
    Takes effort to calculate
    People won't pay all the economic value for something new
    People may value the product less than expected

In any market, some people want to pay more
  It is the duty of the producer to allow them to pay more
Corollary: in any market, some people can only afford to pay less

Versioning = pricing by market segment
  Have three versions:
    Economy model
      Okay for some people, but lacks a feature most people want
    Classic model
      What we hope most people by
    Flagship model
      We expect almost nobody to buy this
      Main purpose: make the classic model look like good value
  We can have more versions if the market is segmentable enough
  We can have fewer versions if it is not feasible
    A small hotel can't afford to construct multiple kinds of rooms
  Pros
    Extracts the most profit
    Delights customers
  Cons
    Makes things more complicated

Smart pricing = pricing by highly specific segments
  Example: seating at the ballet, SF parking meters (price depends on demand)

Pricing tactics
  Discounts and coupons
  Bundling
    Do this when most people want a group of items together
    Example: McDonald's combos
  Unbundling
    Do this when only some people want something
    Example: extra fee for checking bags

Reacting to competitors' pricing moves
  Must determine if the change is permanent
    If their price goes up, can we stay low to grab market share?
    If their price goes down, should we just ride it out?
      Do we risk a "race to the bottom" if we match?

Legal issues in pricing
  Retail price maintenance = forcing distributors to sell at a specific price
    Illegal in the US (hence "suggested" retail prices)
  Price discrimination = charging different people different prices
    Illegal when based on certain attributes (gender, religion, race, ...)

Objective in choosing a channel of distribution (place): minimize inventory
  Inventory is expensive (obsolescence, spoilage, and financing)

Why is one-day shipping so much harder than two-day shipping?
  It's hard to predict how many people will need the service

Functions of intermediaries (wholesalers and retailers)
  Provide availability and geographic coverage
  Reduce the number of transactions in the distribution system
  Bulk-breaking (ensure products are economic to ship but convenient to buy)
When the channel is long, there's usually a good reason
  Example: moving clothes on motorbike to avoid traffic

Logistics = managing physical distribution and related information
  Choice of modality involves tradeoffs (e.g., cost vs. speed)
    Worldwide, airfreight is 2% of weight moved but 40% of value

From factories to distribution centers
  Mostly outsourced to third-party logistics firms (3PLs)
    3PLs can leverage economies of scale and scope
  Containerization permits multi-modal shipping
    Result: factory-to-store shipping costs are only about 1% of retail price
From distribution centers to retail stores
  Easy enough, but the goods the customer wants may be at another store
From distribution centers directly to consumers (e.g., Amazon)
  Last mile problem: the final movement of goods to their destination is hard
    Problems: traffic, parking, doorstep theft, ...
    Solutions: secure pickup lockers, in-store pickup
  In China, last-mile distribution is done by small-scale delivery people
    Would not work in the US because wages are higher

# Lecture 15

Strategy = big picture direction
  Hope is not a strategy

Strategic decisions
  What markets to enter or abandon
  What product lines to develop
  What partnerships to enter
  What companies to acquire or divest
  How to position the brand
  How to win in competition with rivals

Strategic business unit (SBU)
  Run each line of a business as a small company
  Each SBU has its own accounting and management
  SBUs can be individually acquired or divested
Opposite of SBUs: chaebols (large, family-owned conglomerates in South Korea)
  Centralized decision-making

Strategy analysis techniques
  SWOT analysis
    Identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats
      Other things to consider: culture, wishes of owners, industry structure
    Critique: gathers all the facts, but is simplistic
  Porter analysis
    Factors affecting industry competitiveness (lower is better for each):
      Threat of new entrants
      Threat of substitutes
      Industry rivalry
      Power of buyers
      Power of suppliers
    Critique: good for analyzing industries, but not individual firms
  BCG growth-share matrix
    Scatter plot of business units
      Axes: market growth rate and relative market share
      Quadrants:
        Stars (invest heavily)
        Cash cows (nurture)
        Question marks (analyze carefully)
        Dogs (divest or sell)
    Critique: comprehensive and popular, but only useful if you have many SBUs
  GE planning grid
    Another kind of scatter plot
      Axes: market attractiveness and competitive strength
    Critique: multi-dimensional but subjective

Modern strategic themes
  Consider organizing your business in a novel way
    Redbox and Netflix have very different business models (both successful)
  Embrace open systems
    Amazon lists other retailers' offers next to its own
    App stores
  Tolerate creative destruction (be prepared to move on to the next model)

Coopetition = cooperation between competitors
  Netflix is streamed via AWS
    This allowed Netflix to grow rapidly without investing in infrastructure
  USPS is the last mile for many FedEx packages

Competition is good for individual firms
  Spurs product innovation
    H&M and Zara forced the fashion industry to speed up
  Encourages cost reduction
    Dell brought computer prices down industry-wide
  Protects against anti-trust
Firms choose where to compete
  Baidu doesn't do English-language search

Risk identification
  Trends that go against us
    Example: people no longer like to go out to movies
  Strategic events
    Example: if Didi entered the US market
  Unknown unknowns
    Example: SARS shutting down the Hong Kong airport in 2003
Risk assessment
  Time horizon
  Impact and severity
  Probability
    Use hard data, not gut feeling, to prevent optimism bias
Risk management
  Risk avoidance
  Risk transfer (buy insurance, hedge commodity prices, ...)
  Impact mitigation
  Contingency planning (contingent supply chain, flexible staff, ...)
Limitations of risk management
  No insurance company will insure against "ordinary business risk"
