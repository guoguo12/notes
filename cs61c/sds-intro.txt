Clock signal (CLK)
  Repeating square wave

Synchronous digital systems (SDSs)
  Signal changes follow clock changes

Circuits in SDSs
  CL (combinatorial logic) circuits
    No history (e.g. ALUs)
  SL (sequential logic) circuits
    Remember data (e.g. registers)
    AKA state elements

Register internals: d-type flip-flop
  Samples input (d) at rising edge of clock
  Input is transferred to output (q)
Timing terms
  Setup time = period where input must be stable before CLK edge
  Hold time = period where input must be stable after CLK edge
  CLK-to-q delay = time for output to change after CLK edge

Synchronous systems model
  Collection of CL blocks separated by registers
  Clock signals connect to clock inputs of registers
Maximum circuit frequency
  Find max delay by adding CL delays, CLK-to-q delays, and setup times
Pipelining to improve performance
  Insert register after CL block to overlap instructions
  More outputs per second (bandwidth)
  Each individual result takes longer (greater latency)
