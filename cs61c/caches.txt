Typical memory hierarchy
  Register file
  Data and instruction caches
  Secondary-level cache (SRAM)
  Third-level cache (SRAM)
  Main memory (DRAM)
  Secondary memory (disk)
Memory closest to processor is fastest

Temporal locality
  Memory access -> that location will likely be accessed again
Spatial locality
  Memory access -> nearby locations will likely be accessed

Cache is divided into 1+ sets
  Like different walled-off bookshelf sections
Each set holds blocks
  Like an individual book
Each block contains some number of bytes
  Like pages in a book

Processor address fields (high to low)
  Tag
    Selects block within set
    Size is address size - size of index - size of block offset
  Index
    Selects the set
    Size is log(number of sets)
  Block offset
    Selects the byte address within block
    Size is log(number of bytes per block)

Fully associative cache
  Block can go anywhere (most freedom)
  Only one set containing all blocks
N-way set asssociative cache
  N places for a block
  Number of sets = number of blocks / N
Direct mapped cache
  Block goes in one place (least freedom)
  Each set has exactly one block

Cache access
  Cache hit (copy of data found)
    Send to processor
  Cache miss (copy of data not found)
    Read from main memory
    Replace in cache
    Send to processor
Valid bit
  Indicates whether tag entry is valid for this program
    0 -> cache miss (even if address = tag by chance)
    1 -> cache hit

Write-through policy
  Every cache write eventually gets to main memory
  Buffered so write-through can happen in parallel to processing
Write-back policy
  Write cache block back to memory when block is evicted
    Dirty bit is set when processor modifies cache block
  Reduces write traffic

Average memory access time (AMAT)
  Considers cache hits and misses
  Equal to (time for hit) + (miss rate) * (miss penalty)

Total cache capacity
  Equal to (associativity) * (number of sets) * (block size)
    Associativity = blocks per set (AKA "number of ways")
    Block size = bytes per block
