Why C?
  Exploit hardware features
  Become better programmer

Compiling C code
  Map C programs into machine code
  Typically two-part process
    .c files to .o files
    Linking .o files into executables

Advantages of compilation
  Faster runtime execution
  Only changed files need to be recompiled

Disadvantages of compilation
  Compiled files are OS- and processor-specific
  Development may be slower due to build time

C pre-processor (CPP)
  Processes C code before compilation
  Removes comments
  Runs pre-processor commands
    #include for imports
    #define for macro definition

Integers in C
  Size depends on computer (16, 32, or 64)
